# Interactive_Form
 
 This is the third project for TechDegree. It is form submission page for a T-shirt business built with vanilla javascript, HTML/CSS. This project was very challenging! The more I do these projects it feels like techdegree videos are starting to come together. Re doing workspaces to see how they structured similar problems helped, google amd slack were clutch during this project aswell. 

# Skills
Javascript
HTML/CSS

# Future Updates
Need to add a way to prevent submission when user selects conflicting activity times ex: Javascript Libraries Workshop and Javascript Frameworks workshop
